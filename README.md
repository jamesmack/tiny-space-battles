## About
This is my final project for the CENG 356 class at the University of Victoria, taught this year. The goal was to create something that used client-server interactions to communicate Wiimote data. 

## Installation and setup
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7.x. Version 2.7.8 was used for development.
2. Install [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). Version 1.9.1 was used for development.
3. Install [PodSixNet](http://mccormick.cx/projects/PodSixNet/). Release 78 was used for development. 
4. Optionally, install a HID driver for your Wiimote. [WJoy](https://code.google.com/p/wjoy/) was used for development (Mac OS X only).

## To Play
1. Start a server instance
2. Start two client instances
3. Control your ship with the following commands:
  * Keyboard
    * Fire - space key
    * Shield - . (period key)
    * Move up - w
    * Move left - a 
    * Move down - s
