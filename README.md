## About
This is my final project for the CENG 356 class at University of Victoria. The goal was to create something that used client-server interactions to communicate Wiimote data. 

## Installation and setup
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7.x. Version 2.7.8 was used for development.
2. Install [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). Version 1.9.1 was used for development.
3. Install [PodSixNet](http://mccormick.cx/projects/PodSixNet/). Release 78 was used for development. 
4. Optionally, install a HID driver for your Wiimote. [WJoy](https://code.google.com/p/wjoy/) was used for development (Mac OS X only).
